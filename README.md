Colorado Secretary of State bulk download files

These two files allow you to download, unzip and change encoding for bulk downloads from the Colorado Secretary of State's <a herf="http://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/DataDownload.aspx">bulk download area.</a>

If you are using a PC, you may not need the encoding section. It is necessary for Mac OS X, however.

To download years other than 2013, simply change the dates.
